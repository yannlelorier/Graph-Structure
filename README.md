# Graph-Structure
Unofficial implementation of the [Graph-Based Document Structure Analysis](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Fu0aggezN9) paper.


## How to use this?

Download the data at (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ranjay/visualgenome/data/dataset/relationships.json.zip)[Relationships] and (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ranjay/visualgenome/data/dataset/objects.json.zip)[Objects]

This data should be placed under a directory called `data_downloaded_manually` (to be created by you, the user).

to check if this works, just launch:

```sh
python train.py
```

This will launch a test function (which does not work yet).
